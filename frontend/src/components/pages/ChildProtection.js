                <li>All current Sporting kids members with direct access to children and young people will be required to complete and Enhanced Disclosure via the FA CRB Unit. If there are concerns regarding the appropriateness of an individual who is already involved or who has approached us to become part of Sporting kids, guidance will be sought from the NSPCC. It is noted that the FA will consider the relevance and significance of the information obtained via the FA CRB unit Enhanced CRB disclosure and that all decisions will be made in the best interests of children and young people. It is accepted that the FA aims to prevent people with a history of relevant and significant offending from having contact with children or young people and the opportunity to influence policies or practice with children or young people. This is to prevent direct sexual or physical harm to children and to minimise the risk of ‘grooming’ within football.</li>
                <li>Any adult or young person with concerns about a colleague or coach can go direct to the police, social services or the NSPCC. Sporting kids encourages everyone to know about these measures and utilise them if necessary.</li>
                <li>Bullying of any kind is not acceptable in our company or at any of our sessions. If bullying does occur, all players, parents or guardians should be able to tell and know that incidents will be dealt with promptly.

                <li>Codes of conduct for players, parents or spectators, officials and coaches have been implemented by Sporting kids. All prospective members will be informed of these codes.</li>
                <li>Video taking and Photographs – All staff should be vigilant when it comes to photos and video being taken. We do not intend to ban the use of cameras and video in order to analyse coaching and to promote the club. However, there is evidence that some people have used sporting events as an opportunity to take inappropriate photographs or film footage. It is therefore required that parents seek permission from Sporting kids before taking such photographs or video. For more detailed information please see our Photo and Video Policy. In order to avoid ‘grooming’ photographs used by Sporting kids will never be assisted by full names that will assist a third party in identifying the child.</li>
