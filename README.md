# PROJECT FOR SPORTING KIDS - 
https://www.sportingkids.co.uk/

## DURATION - 
3 weeks + 

## MERN STACK - 

Although majority of the website is static. They also wanted a dynamic events page they can add contents to when they have them one, so I picked this as the best Tech to use as its not too heavy and I do enjoy coding in React.

## AIM - 

The clients, Sporting Kids wanted an improvement on their website at a reasonable price so they approached me as the Directors are close friends.

## Client Requirements

* Properly structured pages to hold details relating to a particular service
* More pictures on the website
* Clearer and more visible social media links
* Video on the landing page
* An events page that they can update dynamically 
* About us page with Bio of each coach
* Subscription form for their mailing list

## Research and design phase - 

I had a sit down with the client to better understand who their clients are, mostly Schools and Parents. This automatically gets me thinking that a  responsive website is key, especially for parents who are constantly on the move and will probably be accessing the site via their phones. 

### Design - 

I came up with a design on a wireframe (please see below) which the client was very happy with. I took aspects of their previous website and tried to improve on it where it could, such as the 6 divs on the home page which just served as routers to either the "Childcare" or "Sporting kids" page that the client could have just clicked on in the navbar. My plan was to turn them into modals that held information about that particular service. 

### Future Benga here - 
Both of the above led me to complete a 1 day bootcamp on UX Design with General Assembly which I enjoyed.
